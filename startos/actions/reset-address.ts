/**
 * Replace the client's long-lived SimpleX address with a fresh one.
 *
 * Deleting the address invalidates its connection link (new people can no
 * longer use the old link), but existing contacts already have direct
 * connections and are unaffected. Runs live over the WebSocket, so the service
 * stays up — no stop required.
 *
 * Flow in one WebSocket session:
 *   1. /user            → the active user's id
 *   2. /_delete_address → drop the current address (tolerated if none exists)
 *   3. /_address        → create the replacement, and return its link
 *
 * See:
