The fresh identity reverts to display name "SimpleX Bot" with no profile picture; you can set those again in the Configure Client action once the service is back up. If this client is used with OpenClaw, note that SimpleX reuses low, sequential contact ids after a reset: a brand-new contact can take a former id (such as 4) and OpenClaw would treat them as the old contact, inheriting their session history, pairing approval, and allowlist membership.
