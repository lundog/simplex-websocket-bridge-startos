  version: '0.1.1:0',
  releaseNotes: [
    'Reliability and hardening release — no API changes, no behavior changes for healthy installs.',
    '',
    'Fixes:',
    '- Process supervision — entrypoint now supervises both simplex-chat and websocat. Previously, if simplex-chat crashed while websocat kept running, the StartOS port-listening health check stayed green even though every bot command would hang. The container now exits (and StartOS restarts it) the moment either child dies.',
    '- Entrypoint exits explicitly if simplex-chat does not open its control port within 60 seconds, instead of silently starting the bridge against a dead bot.',
    '',
    'Improvements:',
    '- Daemon stdout/stderr now flow to PID 1 and are captured by StartOS Logs (with automatic rotation). The on-volume bot.log file is gone, which also keeps backups tight.',
    '- Dockerfile pins SHA-256 hashes for the simplex-chat and websocat binaries it downloads, so a compromised release or man-in-the-middle download fails the build.',
    '- Profile Picture field in the Configure action now caps input at ~256KB of binary (≈350KB base64) to prevent accidental giant pastes from bloating the bot profile.',
    '- Reset Profile resolves the volume path through sdk.volumes for type-safety against future manifest changes.',
    '- Instructions clarify that the WebSocket interface has no built-in authentication — anyone who can reach the URL StartOS publishes can drive the bot.',
