/**
 * Translate persisted client settings into the container's start environment.
 *
 * The Docker image (lundog/simplex-websocket-bridge) reads these on start:
 *   PROFILE_DISPLAY_NAME / PROFILE_PEER_TYPE — seed the profile on FIRST start
 *       only; afterwards the profile lives in the DB and is edited over the
 *       WebSocket API (see liveSync.ts). Passing them every start is harmless.
 *   INBOUND_RETENTION_HOURS — positive integer; a janitor deletes received
 *       files older than this. Unset = keep forever.
 *
 * Message relays are deliberately NOT passed as env. simplex-chat persists the
 * `--server`/`--xftp-server` values into the per-user chat database, and the
 * built-in presets are only used when the DB has NO configured servers — so
 * once a custom/local server is set via the flag it sticks even after the flag
 * is removed, and dropping the flag never reverts to the public presets. To
 * make the selection authoritative we instead apply it over the WebSocket API
 * on every (re)start — see configureServers in liveSync.ts — which both sets
 * custom/local servers and resets to presets for public.
