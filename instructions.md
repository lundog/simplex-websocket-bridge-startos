# SimpleX Chat

Welcome! This package runs SimpleX Chat as a headless bot, with a WebSocket
interface so you can drive it from any client that speaks the SimpleX terminal
chat protocol.

## Warning: Anonymous Access Allowed
The WebSocket has no built-in auth — anything that can reach the URLs that StartOS publishes can drive the bot. Use StartOS's LAN/Tor controls to restrict access.

## Configuration

The bot's own profile is its configuration — there's no separate StartOS-side
config file. Open the **Configure** action to view and edit the live profile:

- **Display Name** — the name peers see when they connect.
- **Profile Picture** — a base64 data URL (e.g.
  `data:image/jpg;base64,...`). Leave empty to remove the current picture.
  Small images (< 64KB) render best in SimpleX clients.

When you submit, the change is pushed straight to the running bot — no
restart, no impact on existing contacts or chats.

> File sharing is enabled by default (the bot is launched with
> `--create-bot-allow-files`). To turn it off after the fact, connect over the
> WebSocket and send the `/set files` command — see the
> [bot command reference](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/bots/api/COMMANDS.md).

## How to add a new contact

1. Start the service.
2. Run the **Create Invitation** action. The bot creates a fresh
   one-time invitation link and shows it to you with a QR code.
3. Send the link (or QR) to the person you want to invite. They paste it into
   their SimpleX client to connect.

Each link can be redeemed by exactly one peer. To invite another contact, run
the action again to get a new link.

## Connecting programmatically

This package exposes a single **WebSocket** interface. Open this package's UI
in StartOS, look under *Interfaces* → *WebSocket*, and copy the URL — StartOS
gives you the right hostname and port for your network (LAN, Tor, etc.).
Connect any WebSocket client to that URL.

### Command format

The bot doesn't accept raw command strings over the WebSocket; every command
must be wrapped in a small JSON envelope:

```json
{ "corrId": "any-id-you-pick", "cmd": "/help" }
```

- `corrId` is a correlation id you choose. The bot echoes it back in the
  matching response so you can pair requests and replies when multiple are in
  flight. Any unique string works.
- `cmd` is the SimpleX terminal command, exactly as you'd type it into the
  `simplex-chat` CLI (leading slash included).

Each reply is a JSON object containing the same `corrId` plus a `resp` field
with the command's result. The bot may also push unsolicited event messages
(without your `corrId`) — incoming chats, contact updates, etc.

See the upstream
[SimpleX bots — sending commands](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/bots/README.md#sending-commands)
guide for the full protocol, and the
[CLI command reference](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/docs/CLI.md)
for the list of `cmd` values you can send.

### A few useful commands

- `/user` — get the active user.
- `/_connect 1` — create a one-time invitation link for user ID 1 (the same thing the
  *Create Invitation* action does).
- `/contacts` — list peers who have connected.
- `/profile <name>` — change the bot's display name.

Wrapped, those look like:

```json
{ "corrId": "1", "cmd": "/user" }
{ "corrId": "2", "cmd": "/_connect 1" }
{ "corrId": "3", "cmd": "/contacts" }
{ "corrId": "4", "cmd": "/profile <name>" }
```

A response for the first command will look like this:

```json
{
    "corrId": "1",
    "resp": {
        "type": "activeUser",
        "user": {
            "userId": 1,
            "profile": {
                "displayName": "SimpleX Bot"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Backups

The bot's profile, configuration, and chat history all live in the `main`
volume, which is included in StartOS backups. Restoring a backup brings the
bot back with its original identity, contacts, and message history.

## Reset

If you ever want to start from a fresh identity, run the **Reset Profile**
action (under *Danger Zone*). The service must be stopped first. The action
deletes the bot identity, all contacts, and all chat history. Once you start
the service again, the bot boots back up with display name **SimpleX Bot**
and no profile picture — you can change those again in *Configure*.

## Where to find things

- **WebSocket URL** — *Interfaces* → *WebSocket* in this package's StartOS UI.
- **Profile (display name + picture)** — *Configure* action.
- **Invitation links** — *Create Invitation* action (one-time, generated
  on demand).
- **Reset** — *Reset Profile* action.
