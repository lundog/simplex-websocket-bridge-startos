# We run two long-lived processes inside this container:
#
#   1. simplex-chat — the SimpleX terminal client in bot mode, listening for
#      WebSocket connections on 127.0.0.1:5226 (container-local).
#   2. websocat — translates external WebSocket connections on
#      0.0.0.0:5225 into local connections to simplex-chat.
#
# If either process exits unexpectedly, the service is broken: a dead
# simplex-chat with a live websocat is an especially nasty silent failure
# (the port still listens, the StartOS port-listening health check stays
# green, but every command times out). So this script supervises both — if
# either child dies, we kill the other and exit non-zero so StartOS restarts
# the container.
#
# Note: --create-bot-display-name and --create-bot-allow-files only take
# effect on the very first start, when no profile exists yet. After that,
# the bot's display name and file-sharing setting live on its persisted
# profile and are edited through the StartOS "Configure" action.
